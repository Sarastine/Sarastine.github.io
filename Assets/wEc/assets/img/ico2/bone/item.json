    "description": "Bones are obtained by killing Skeletons.  In addition to be craftable into [[Bone Meal]], they can be used to tame wolves into dogs.  Simply right-click a wolf with a bone, and you'll have a small chance to convert it into a dog.  It usually takes around 10 bones to \"tame\" a wolf.  When tamed, hearts will spring up from the wolf, and it will obtain a colored collar."
