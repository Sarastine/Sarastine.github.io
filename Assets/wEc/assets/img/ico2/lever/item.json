    "description": "Levers are a used to create a permanent redstone signal on demand.  When the switch is placed on a wall, it will be \"off\" when in the up position, and \"on\" when in the down position.  When \"on\", it generates a redstone signal equivalent to a [[Redstone Torch]].  It is also the cheapest way to generate a redstone signal, requiring just a stick and a chunk of cobblestone."
